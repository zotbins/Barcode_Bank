# Barcode Bank Scripts

These are some basic scripts to help with handling the barcodes we receieve.

All of these scripts require Pandas to run, so install using the command:

```python
pip install pandas
```

## find_duplicates.py

This script finds all the duplicates barcodes in a CSV and writes a new CSV with the output.

## delete_duplicates.py

This script takes in a CSV of rows to be deleted and the original CSV, and outputs a new CSV without the duplicates.
